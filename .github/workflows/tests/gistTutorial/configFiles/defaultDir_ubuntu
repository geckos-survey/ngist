# This file contains default paths to input data, outputs, additional configuration files, and spectral template
# libraries. All paths specified in MasterConfig are considered to be relative to the paths stated here. This file is
# only used if its absolute path is provided to the nGIST with the command line argument --default-dir. 
#
# It is possible to specify that the configuration and output directories are identical. To this end, set e.g.:
#   outputDir=/User/somePath
#   configDir=outputDir
#
# Please note that configDir and templateDir are not applied automatically to user-defined parameters and/or
# user-defined modules. inputDir and outputDir are applied to all active nGIST modules.
