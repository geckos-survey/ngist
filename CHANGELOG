VERSION    DATE          DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V7.2.1	     2024-07-28 ADDED: Ability to create BPT maps in the GAS module if all required
			emission lines are present. Note: there is currently no AoN 
			threshold applied to these lines.

V7.2.0       2024-07-21 ADDED: Implemented MC realizations to estimate
			 uncertainties of template weights and mean stellar population properties
			 for the SFH module using the method in Pessa et al. 2023-AA.


V7.1.0	     2024-07-20 ADDED: Added a new option for an SNR-dependent bias setting similar 
			 to what was adopted for SAMI in van de Sande et al. 2017-ApJ
			 The new option can be called as "muse" which uses the SNR from the best-fit 
			 solution or "muse_snr_prefit" that uses the snr from the pre-scaled variance
			 
V7.0.0	     2024-07-08 CHANGED: New user module added called UMOD. This currently only 
			 accepts a twocomp_ppxf fitting function.
			 FIXED:
			 Minor fixes and code cleanup.

V6.1.1	     2024-07-03 FIXED:
			 Multiple bugs in multiple modules. Please use commit history for all changes.
			 CHANGED:
			 Turned saving AllSpectra.fits module back on if GAS is fitted in SPAXEL mode,
			 but AllSpectra.fits is removed once GAS routine has finished running.			 
		 
V6.1.0	     2024-06-24 FIXED:
			 Multiple bugs in multiple modules. Please use commit history for all changes.
			 CHANGED:
			 Turned off saving AllSpectra.fits module.
			 ADDED:
			 Two component stellar kinematic fitting module in pPXF. Calling sequence 
			 "TWOCOMP_KIN" with "twocomp_ppxf.py". Only works with MOM = 2 and MILES SSP 
			 library.

V6.0.1	     2024-04-24 FIXED:
			 Minor fixes and code cleanup

V6.0.0       2024-04-18 FIXED:
			 Parallel = False in SFH module
			 REMOVED:
			 Template reshape immediately after creation in SFH module
			 ADDED:
		  	 Template reshape before creation of optimal_template in run_ppxf
 			 ADDED:
		  	 Continuum normalisation step before running pPXF in KIN, CONT, and
			 SFH modules.

V5.4.5	     2024-04-18 ADDED:
			 The ability to return an E(B-V) dust map in the SFH module.

V5.4.4       2024-03-25 CHANGED:
			 Name from gist-geckos to nGIST!
			 ADDED:
			 The ability to define the BIAS value in the KIN module. If not set by the
			 user, the default value in the MasterConfig file is 'Auto', which uses the
			 default implementation provided with pPXF from Cappellari & Emsellem 2004.
			 CHANGED:
			 _initialise.py ascii text art to reflect code name change.

V5.4.3 	     2024-01-29 CHANGED:
			 addGISTHeaderComment so that it doesn't need to open the every fits file
			 and so that only the ext[0] has the gist-geckos branding added. This
			 saves a lot of time.
			 ADDED:
			 XBIN and YBIN pixel Voronoi bin centres to the SPATIAL_BINNING maps files.

V5.4.2	     2024-01-12 FIXED:
			 Bug that was introduced into the CONT module in V5.4.1 that caused it
			 to run, even when results were already in the results directory and
			 OW_OUTPUT = False.

V5.4.1	     2024-01-11 REMOVED:
			 'KIN' from the continuum cube file names, as this is now a separate module
			 Superfluous Fits header updates that occured even when OW_OUTPUT was set
			 to False. These updates now only occur if OW_OUTPUT = True or the files are
			 being created for the first time.

V5.4.0	     2024-01-10 FIXED:
			 Bug in GAS module that prevented the _BIN and _SPAXEL maps files from saving
			 when run in 'BOTH' mode.
			 OW_OUTPUT = False still overwriting results in the GAS module.
			 ADDED:
		     Hardcoded ADEG=-1 into the continuum module to be in line with the procedure for
			 the GAS and SFH modules. The configFile keyword ['CONT']['ADEG'] is no longer
			 required and should be removed from your MasterConfig.yaml file.

V5.3.2       2023-12-13  FIXED:
			 Fixed bug in WriteFits LS module where it wasn't using the idx_inside selection

V5.3.1       2023-12-11  CHANGED:

			 use of emission line cleaned spectra from the Emission Line Fitting Module.
			 Minor changes to 'ppxf.py' scripts for printing status during fitting.

V5.2.3       2023-12-09  FIXED:
			 Changed the velscale_ratio from 1 to 2 to match the KIN and SFH
			 module.

V5.2.2       2023-12-08  FIXED:
			 Galaxy spectra our now normalised before being fitted in the
			 StellarKinematics and SFH modules. Output best-fit model is scaled
			 back to match original flux of galaxy spectrum.

V5.2.1       2023-11-23  ADDED:
			 SPATIAL_BINNING module now outputs maps for table.fits. StellarKinematics
			 and SFH modules now calculates the postfit signal-to-noise ratio from the
			 residuals and output these in the saved fits files

V5.2.0       2023-11-8  ADDED:
			 A new continuum module was created based on the StellarKinematics module.

V5.1.5       2023-10-11  FIXED:
			 SFH module ppxf.py so that it now recognises whether the emission
			 line module has already been run. If so, it will take the emission-
			 subtracted 'cleaned' spectrum as input to the SFH module.

V5.1.4       2023-09-12  ADDED:
			 Ability to turn the pPXF CLEAN function on or off using the keywords:
			 config['KIN']['DOCLEAN'] = True/False
			 config['SFH']['DOCLEAN'] = True/False
			 FIXED:
			 Cleaned the ppxf.py SFH module code to match the format of Kinematic module

V5.1.3       2023-08-10  ADDED:
			 Ability to use the stellar templates from Walcher et al. 2009
			 in the stellar kinematics module.
			 To use this option, the keywords have to be :
			 config['KIN']['LSF_TEMP'] = 'lsf_WALCHER'
			 config['KIN']['TEMPLATE_SET'] = 'walcher'
			 config['KIN']['LIBRARY'] = '/Walcher/'

V5.1.2       2023-08-07  FIXED:
			 Ability to run spaxel-based emission line fits using the pPXF module.
			 if config['GAS']['METHOD'] = 'ppxf', 'MAGPIGandalf', or 'Gandalf',
 			 config['GAS']['LEVEL'] can be 'BIN' or 'SPAXEL' ('BOTH not yet implemented
			 for ppxf module.
			 ADDED:
			 config['GENERAL']['OUTPUT']_KIN_ORIGcube.fits, a file containing the
			 original spectra cut to the wavelength range at which the continuum
			 cube was made, for use with config['GENERAL']['OUTPUT']_KIN_CONTcube.fits
			 and config['GENERAL']['OUTPUT']_KIN_LINEcube.fits for work with the
			 continuum cubes.

V5.1.1       2023-07-28  ADDED:
			 Ability to implement a foreground Galactic dust extinction using the
			 config['READ_DATA']['EBmV'] keyword.

			 A new ppxf-based emission line fitting module based on the PHANGS DAP

V5.0.5       2023-07-18  ADDED:
			 SFH module has been updated to use a 3-step noise estimation and
			 sigma clipping method, in line with the stellar kinematics module.

V5.0.4.	     2023-05-26  ADDED:
			 MAGPI gandalf implementation sub-module. There are now two options
			 for GAS METHOD: 'gandalf' and 'MAGPI_gandalf'. Recommend adopting
			 'MAGPI_gandalf' from now on.

V5.0.3.      2023-05-24  ADDED:
			 Code to subtract the bestfit stellar continuum and construct a
			 continuum subtracted cube.

V5.0.2       2023-05-17  FIXED:
			 * Identified origin of LSF module crash which was due to a bug in
			 ppxf_util.gaussian_filter1d(). This bug will be fixed in version
			 8.2.5 of pPXF. In older pPXF version replace line 665 in
			 ppxf_util.py with p = int(1.0 + 4*np.max(sig))

V5.0.1       2023-05-05   FIXED:
			 * Fixed bugs in mapviewer/createFigure.py and mapviewer/helperFunctions.py
			 by changing all references of PyQT to PyQT5,
			 * Fixed bug in mapviewer/plotData.py by changing np.int to np.int32

V5.0	    2023-04-06	CHANGED:
			 * Created the ability to use multiple stellar template libraries in the one GIST
             call. This will be useful is you for e.g. want to use one template set for
			 the stellar kinematics, and another for the emission lines and stellar populations.
			 * MasterConfig.yaml now has a slightly different format, where you define the
			 template set used for each module individually.

V4.0.1	    2023-03-27	 FIXED:
			* Fixed bug in MUSE_WFM.py to accept cubes with more than 2
			  extensions.
			* Fixed calculation of SNR, which was done as median(flux)/median(error)
			  but should be defined as median(flux/error)
			* Updated spatialMasking default.py script to allow for using actual
			  SNR cutoff of spaxels instead of isophote based SNR. Two choices are
			  the default threshold_method = 'isophote' and threshold_method =
			 'actual'. Two choices are NOT available within yaml file just yet.

V4.0	    2023-03-09	 First version of the gist-geckos pipeline!
			CHANGED:
			* Updated the MasterConfig file to MasterConfig.yaml to make more
			  human-readable. This is now the input file to use.
			* Updated _initialise.py and main_pipeline.py to accept YAML.
			* New GIST call is:
			  gistPipeline --config configFiles/MasterConfig.yaml --default-dir configFiles/defaultDir

V3.0.4     2021-03-19    FIXED:
			  * Replaced MUSE_WFMAO read-in routine by MUSE_WFMAON and
			    MUSE_WFMAOE to account for the distinct wavelength ranges
			    affected by the LGS facility in the nominal and extended modes
			    of the MUSE wide-field mode.
			    Thanks to Aishwarya Girdhar for pointing out this bug.
			  * Fixed Mapviewer, gandalf.py, and gistPlot_kin.py to work with
			    only two kinematic moments. Thanks to Sebastien Comeron for
			    reporting these issues.

			    plain spectrum (without any other analysis) is displayed.
			    Thanks to Sebastien Comeron for pointing out these bugs.

V3.0.2     2020-10-19    FIXED:
			  * Fixed typo in log-messages from read-in routines
			  * Fixed bug in gandalf.py that prevented some output columns to
			    be written to disk. Thanks to Andrew Battisti for pointing
			    out these two issues.

V3.0.1     2020-09-03    CHANGED:
			  * Assure compatibility with pPXF version 7 by adopting the
			    _bvls_solve and nnls_flags from pPXF version 6 into pyGandALF.
			    Thanks to Michele Cappellari for his permission to include
			    these functions.
			  * Relaxed version dependencies of other packages in setup.py.
			  * Changed the default value of the ftol parameter in pyGandALF
			    to 1e-5, in order to improve the reliability of the fit.
