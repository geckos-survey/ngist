------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V3.0.1     2020-09-03    CHANGED: 
			  * Assure compatibility with pPXF version 7 by adopting the 
			    _bvls_solve and nnls_flags from pPXF version 6 into pyGandALF.
			    Thanks to Michele Cappellari for his permission to include 
			    these functions. 
			  * Relaxed version dependencies of other packages in setup.py.
			  * Changed the default value of the ftol parameter in pyGandALF 
			    to 1e-5, in order to improve the reliability of the fit.

V3.0       2020-08-20    Substantial revision and restructuring of the source code. Please
			 consider the documentation for a detailed description of all 
			 changes. 

V2.1       2020-04-06	 CHANGED: 
			  * Changed definition of npad variable in Gandalf analogue 
			    to PPXF. Thanks to Alireza Molaeinezhad for the suggestion. 
			  * Check dimensions of templates at read-in to allow the use of 
			    Miles stars. Thanks to Thomas Spriggs for the suggestion. 
			  * Modified CALIFA read-in routines to pass variances in 
			    error spectra. 
			 FIXED:
			  * Added missing np.sqrt in the calculation of error spectra
			    of bins consisting of single spaxels. Thanks to Sebastien 
			    Comeron for reporting this bug. 
			  * Neglect negative BIN_IDs in the calculation of the reference 
			    velocity in Mapviewer. Thanks to Isabel Pérez. 
			  * Enable DEBUG-mode in read-in routines by passing shape of cube
			    Thanks to Adriano Poci for reporting this bug. 
			  * Mapviewer: Plot the spectrum of the nearest valid bin if a bin
			    outside of the Voronoi-region is selected. 
			    Thanks to Michela Rubino. 

V2.0.0     2019-11-13    ADDED: 
			  * Support different wavelength ranges in different modules,
			    including a separate wavelength range for the SNR calculation.
			  * Support AO in MUSE wide- and narrow-field mode
			    Thanks to Sebastien Comeron for the suggestion. 
			  * Support of sky-lines in spectralMasking_*.config
			    Thanks to Sebastien Comeron for the suggestion. 
			 CHANGED: 
			  * Propagate defunct spaxels through the pipeline

V1.1.1     2019-10-31    FIXED: 
			  * Apply de-redshifting to laser wavelength range in MUSE_NFM.py
			  * Apply de-redshifting to LSF
			    Thanks to Sebastien Comeron for reporting these bugs. 

V1.1.0     2019-08-16    ADDED:   
			  * Allow different initial guesses for different bins in pPXF
			    Thanks to Michela Rubino for the suggestion. 
			  * Read-in routine for single spectra in txt-format "PLAINTXT.py"
	      	   	 FIXED:   
			  * spectralMasking_SFH.config to handle one or zero masks
	      	   	  * Orientation of maps in plotting routines
	      	   	  * GandALF taking into account the LSF in doublet lines
	      	   	 CHANGED:
			  * Use stellar kinematics as initial guess on GandALF fit
	      	   	  * Use np.nansum instead of np.nanmean to co-add spectra into 
			    Voronoi-bins
	      	   	  * Pass ORIGIN in units of pixels
	      	   	 REMOVED:
			  * *_gandalf-residuals_*.fits output

V1.0.0     2019-06-11    Release of first version
